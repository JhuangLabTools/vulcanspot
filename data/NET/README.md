# Drug-Protein-Protein Interaction Network
Herein, universal (pan-cancer) and contextualized (only proteins that are expressed in cell lines from a given cell lineage) are presented. These networks are generated by aggregating the drug-target interactions described in the CLUE database (clue.io/api) with a Protein-Protein Interaction network (provided by PINA, only physical interactions described in more than one resource). The scripts that generate these networks are coordinated in `./src/04_drug_prescription.sh`:

*  `./src/__NET_create_DrugProteinProtein_interaction_usingPINA.R`
* `./src/__NET_contextualize_DrugPPIN.R`

The original file (`PINA_Homosapiens-20140521.tsv`) from PINA is downloaded automatically, but not stored in the repository because of large file size (144M).
